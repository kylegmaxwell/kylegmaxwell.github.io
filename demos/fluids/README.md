# Introduction
This is a two dimensional fluid solver for smoke.
The solver is implemented using the techniques from Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games (Stam 03).
Vorticity confinement is also implemented to add extra turbulent detail.

# TODO
Touch screen inputs
Color
Switch ordering of i, j loops for caching?
Refactor grids to be structs of arrays, not arrays of structs?
